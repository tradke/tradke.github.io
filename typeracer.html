                    During the summer of 2018 I decided to teach myself "proper" touch typing on <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/">play.typeracer.com</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    This project was multipurpose. It let me reflect on my progress which is an important step in further improvement. Moreover, it gave me an opportunity to dig my teeth into Excel, where most of this project was done.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, I would like to credit <a href="https://typeracerdata.com/profile?username=tythal">typeracerdata.com</a> for inspiring or simplifying several parts of this undertaking.

                <p>
                    Typeracer emphasizes your current wpm as an average of your 10 most recent races. In the scorecard snapshot at the top of this page, my last 10 races came out to 106 wpm. Unfortunately, this average is sensitive to a series of good or bad races. In my case, it has swung from 90 to 110 wpm in a short period. On the other hand, my full average of 87.3 wpm is weighed down by the hundreds or thousands of races it took to improve from my humble beginnings. A more reasonable judge of my current level lies between these extremes.
                    <br><br>
                    The table and chart below include different Simple Moving Averages (SMA). SMA(n) yields the averages of n contiguous points. So a plot of SMA(10) will illustrate a moving average of 10 races. The chart below does well to illustrate the problems with SMA(10) and the full average when compared to SMA(100) or the more gradual SMA(1000). 
                    <br><br>
                    I was quite surprised to see the standard deviation of the first 1000 and last 1000 races were so similar. However, deviating by 9.5 around an average of 101.7 is a lot less striking than the deviation of 9.4 from 67.0 wpm. This concept is summarized as the coefficient of variation (CoV). A larger CoV indicates greater relative spread.

                <p>
                    I chose to define marathon as the number of races completed in a single calendar day.
                    <br><br>
                    This metric was inspired by typeracerdata.com. They define a marathon as the number of races completed in any 24-hour block. This allows your marathon to bridge adjacent calendar days. As such, their definition found my top marathon to be
                        <span>
                            121 races in 24 hours, starting 2021 November 29, 9:23pm.
                        </span>
                    <br><br>
                    Each measure has some strengths and weaknesses. Marathons by calendar day is simple and unambiguous, but it fails to capture races in the same session that go beyond midnight (see Race Count by Hour). Marathons by any 24-hour block resolve this problem but are subject to counting unrelated sessions. In my case, high activity the night of Nov 29th, and high activity the afternoon of the 30th compose my top marathon of 121 races.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps a better approach, given what we know about this data, would require defining a "marathon day" that lasts 24-hours and begins at 5:00am. This regularly separates race activity (as seen in the Race Count by Hour figure) while maintaining the essence of a marathon. The drawback is complexity.

                        It is now time to make it unclear. To write off lines that don't make sense. I love myself better than you. I know it's wrong so what should I do? And one more special message to go, and then I'm done, and I can go home. I love myself better than you. I know it's wrong so what should I do?

                        There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have? So, let's just say I'm driving this buggy, and if you fix your attitude, you can ride along with me. Now you will see me one more time, if you do good. You will see me two more times, if you do bad.

                        So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking, racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
