        <section class="intro">
            <p>During the summer of 2018 I decided to train myself on "proper" touch typing.
                I was already familiar with typeracer at the time, and as soon as I found out I could download my data I knew I wanted to make a project out of it.
                <br><br>
                This scatterplot depicts a high-level summary of my progress thus far. The following sections will explore my typeracer activity, individual race analysis, and a deep dive on my WPM improvement.

                These charts illustrate my racing activity broken down by year, month, day of the week, and hour (in local time). They largely speak for themselves, but there are a few points worth discussing. 
                <br>TODO: the horizontal line denotes the average. Put another way, it illustrates the level if all races were completed uniformly 
            </p>
            <p>
                Activity in 2020 was dramatically less than that of adjacent years. One contributing factor may have been the onset of COVID and COVID restrictions in Canada. I fondly remember the mass exodus from residence during March 2020, and how the delightful chaos that ensued for the remainder of that winter semester.
