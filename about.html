            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I am a recent graduate from the University of Alberta with a BSc in <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-of-science-with-specialization-mathematics---computational-science.html">Math and Computing Science</a>. This program allowed me to fuel my passion for mathematics with the power of computing science. My favorite subjects were Calculus and Database Management.
                <br><br>
                Since finishing school I have been experiencing the beauty Alberta has to offer, cherishing the people and pets around me, and continuing to be a life-long learner!
                <br><br>
                I am currently looking for work related to Data Science, Analytics, or Game Dev. You can reach me at tradke /at/ ualberta /dot/ ca.
