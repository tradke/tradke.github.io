            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I am a recent graduate from the University of Alberta with a BSc in <a href="https://apps.admissions.ualberta.ca/programs/sc/sc020/mcomp">Math and Computing Science</a>.
                <br><br>
                For most of my life, my master status has been that of a student. I have always loved and excelled in school, and while I am eager to return for graduate studies in the future, I am currently looking for work!
                <br><br>
                I feel most comfortable in the realms of Math and Computing Science, with a particular interest for Data Science, Analytics, and Game-Dev. While this website was fun and multi-purpose, I am not pursuing web development.
                <br><br>
                Since finishing school I have been experiencing the beauty Alberta has to offer, cherishing the people and pets around me, and continuing to be a life-long learner.
